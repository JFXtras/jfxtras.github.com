== Agenda
Agenda is an implementation of a calendar component similar to Google Calendar.

Some attention points are:

* Appointments can be dragged, resized, created and its properties can be edited via a popup window.
* Appointments are part of groups, which dictates the color that is used.
* Whole-day appointments, unlike those in Google calendar, have a visual presence on the whole day: a small vertical bar runs from the label at the top along the whole day, indicating that a whole-day appointment is in effect. This is called a 'flag pole'.

A crucial aspect to grasp when using Agenda is that you (the user of the Agenda control) are in charge of populating the appointments list, Agenda just renders and manipulates them.
ICalendarAgenda is an extension to Agenda, which picks up where Agenda stops in that it maintains this appointments list, by using the iCalendar standard to generate repeating appointments.
