{"name":"JFXtras 2","body":"### Welcome to the JFXtras Project.\r\nThe goal of JFXtras is to provide those pieces that developers often need in their day-to-day work, but that are currently missing from [JavaFX](http://www.javafx.com).  This project will also serve as a proving ground for controls that may some day make it into the official JavaFX distribution.\r\n\r\nJFXtras began life as a library of add-on components for JavaFX 1.x.  The original components were all written in the now defunct JavaFX Script language.  This current incarnation of the project is targeted at the Java-based JavaFX 2.x library and is a completely new code base.\r\n\r\n### JFXtras and JFXtras Labs\r\nThe project is divided into two different pieces.  Components in the official JFXtras library are considered stable with APIs that are unlikely to change much in future releases.  The JFXtras Labs library contains components that are currently under active development and are considered experimental.  The API of the components may change significantly from one release to the next.\r\n\r\nOnce the JFXtras developers feel that a component has reached a mature state, it will be moved from Labs into the main JFXtras library.\r\n\r\nCurrently **all** components are in Labs.\r\n\r\nJFXtras and JFXtras Labs are licensed under the [BSD License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nYou can download this project in either [zip](https://github.com/jfxtras/jfxtras/zipball/master) or [tar](https://github.com/jfxtras/jfxtras/tarball/master) formats.\r\n\r\nYou can also clone the project with [Git](http://git-scm.com) by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/jfxtras/jfxtras\r\n\r\n-- or --\r\n\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/jfxtras/jfxtras-labs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe following people have contributed to the JFXtras 2 project.\r\n\r\n* Stephen Chin (@steveonjava)\r\n* Dean Iverson (@deanriverson)\r\n* Tom Eugelink (@tbee)\r\n* Gerrit Grunwald (@HanSolo)\r\n* Thomas Bolz (@teabeeoh)\r\n* Jonathan Giles (@JonathanGiles)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nMailing lists\r\n","tagline":"A set of high quality controls and add-ons for JavaFX 2.0.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
